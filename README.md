# CS355 Project

In this project, we implemented a communication channel and protocol that enables two participants, Alice and Bob, to check if they have any files in common without revealing the contents of the file to one another.

### Languages and Libraries Used
This project was completed in _Python_, and we made use of the _PyCryptodome_ library, which includes an implementation of the RSA algorithm. We also used the _hashlib_ module, a common interface for cryptographic hash functions, from which we used SHA-256.
